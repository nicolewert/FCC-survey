- Version 1 -> the form I originally created for the curiculum (Feburary 2021).
- Version 2 -> an improved form I created following a figma that I designed and implemented with css/bootstrap (October 2021).
 
 ## Through this project I learned how to:  
  - implement mobile-first design 
  - work with figma to design the form
  - do cross-browser and mobile responsivenss testing in the browser
  - utilize flexbox and grid to create nested layouts
  - use media queries to distinguish between smaller "mobile" and larger "web" sizes
