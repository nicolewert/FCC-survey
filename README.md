# FreeCodeCamp Survey Project [![Website shields.io](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/http/shields.io.svg)](http://shields.io/)

A simple **HTML CSS** project I completed for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum.   
  
 - The purpose of this project was to practice working with forms.  
  
 - In the future I hope to implement improved css/bootstrap design :)
